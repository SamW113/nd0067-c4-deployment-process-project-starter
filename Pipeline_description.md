# Pipeline Description

## Overview

This document outlines the steps involved in the CI/CD pipeline for the Udagram application. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Steps in the Pipeline

1. **Checkout Code**

   - The pipeline begins by checking out the latest code from the repository. This ensures that the most recent changes are included in the build process.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - The next step involves installing the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend applications. This is done using the `npm install` command, which reads the `package.json` files and installs the required packages.

3. **Run Linting**

   - After installing dependencies, the pipeline runs linting checks on the code. This step helps identify and fix potential issues in the codebase, ensuring that it adheres to coding standards.

4. **Build Applications**

   - The pipeline then builds both the frontend and backend applications. This step compiles the code and prepares it for deployment. For example, the frontend is built using Angular's build command.

5. **Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk**

   - Once the build and tests are successful, the application is deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The `eb deploy` command is used to upload the application code and create or update the environment.

6. **Monitor Deployment**
   - After deployment, the pipeline monitors the health of the Elastic Beanstalk environment to ensure that the application is running smoothly. Any issues detected during this phase are logged for further investigation.

## Conclusion

This CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the Udagram application, allowing for faster and more reliable releases. By following these steps, we ensure that our application is always in a deployable state and meets quality standards.
