# Udagram - Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a cloud-enabled image filtering web application that allows users to register, log in, post photos to a public feed, and apply filtering effects to the uploaded images. This application is part of a full-stack project comprising both frontend and backend components.

## üìù Project Overview

This application demonstrates a full-stack cloud-based image processing workflow with the following main features:

- **User Registration and Authentication** (JWT-based)
- **Image Uploading** to cloud storage
- **Photo Feed Display** showing all uploaded photos
- **Image Filtering Service** with effects applied on the fly
- **Frontend** built with Angular using the Ionic framework
- **Backend** developed with Node.js and TypeScript following RESTful principles

The app architecture includes secure login, token-based session handling, and integration with AWS services (like S3) for media storage.
